Bayesian-Spatiotemporal-Wombling
================

This GitHub repository contains materials to reproduce analyses, visualizations, and
tables for the manuscript titled, "Bayesian Spatiotemporal Wombling", authored by Aritra Halder, Didong Li & Sudipto Banerjee. 

The content of this repository includes a roadmap explaining the workflow to reproduce the analysis in the manuscript. Detailed descriptions for each script is provided to aid in the execution. 
The functions used are from the `sptwombling` (author + maintainer: Aritra Halder). The code folder contains the key functions instrumental in execution. 

See the [sptwombling R package](https://github.com/arh926/sptwombling) repository for further details.

### Roadmap of the Repository

| *code* | contains source code from `sptwombling` relevant for preforming the analysis in `.R` format |
| *data* | contains data used in Section 6 of the manuscript|
| *output* | contains simulation scripts for results and figures in the manuscript in `.R` format|
| *script* | data analyses/simulations working scripts in `.R` format|

The datasets required to reproduce the tables are too large in size to include here.
